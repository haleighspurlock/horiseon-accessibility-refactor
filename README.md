# Horiseon Accessibility Refactor

## Description

Horiseon Marketing Agency was looking for a way to make their user experience more accessible. This is the code refactor with comments to describe all action taken in improving the code.

This was done utilizing the provided html and css code already functioning on their website. The refactor allowed for this code to be condensed and organized where applicable. It allows others to read the code more easily, as it eliminates redundant items and allows code to flow cleanly.

During the course of this project I was able to learn to accurately read the code provided to me to see what actions it preformed, then take that code and make small changes to improve functionality. For example, if we had multiple classes that could function as one singular class and be applied to all utilizing parties, I was able to do that. I was able to see the importance of being able to read code before trying to write and/or edit it. The biggest thing I took away from this project is how easy it is to change multiple things in a file, but the final product continues to look same. There are so many changes I made to improve the cleanliness of the code, yet the webpage will keep it's design.
